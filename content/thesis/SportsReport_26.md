#### Work done
- Work ongoing for draft of paper. Most sections are complete, need to include the details of new method once results are available. [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/znvwpcrvpfbp)
- Finished total annotation of one more match video and almost completed annotation of another one. With this a total of 5 video will be fully annotated.
    - Russia vs. Croatia; 7 July '18; iTV - UK;
    - Croatia vs. England; 11 July '18; Fox -US;
- Did not see an improvement with training domain adaptation only on soccer videos information. Started training videos with person annotations from MS Coco as the opposing domain instead.
