## Work done:
- Identified possible tools for helping with audio annotation
- Read papers on Sports Analytics to try and get a basic understanding of the work done in the field.

### Tool for Audio annotation
- I indentified a few tools that can be used for Audio annotation. I will try them out and get the annotators started on the annotation by today.
  - Aenes: This is an automatic forced alignment tool that seems to be working very well. It aligns the text with the audio automatically. [link](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Ramanathan_Detecting_Events_and_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)
  - Higgins Annotation Tool: This is usually used in professional settings where films are annotated with dialogues and multi-channel audio, but can be used with single speaker as well.
  - We may also want to look at building our own annotation tool, which I can do in a few days. Since our further objecting would be recording data ourselves.

## Sports Analytics:
Here are some of the papers that I have gone through to get some background in the area.
- What will Happen Next? Forecasting Player Moves in Sports Videos, ICCV'17 [paper](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017/papers/Felsen_What_Will_Happen_ICCV_2017_paper.pdf)
- Not all passes are created equal: Objectively measuring the risk and reward of passes in soccer from tracking data, SIGKDD'17 [paper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3098051)
- Detecting Events and Key Actors in Multi-Person Videos, CVPR'16  [paper](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Ramanathan_Detecting_Events_and_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)
- SmartTennisTV: An automatic indexing system for tennis, NCVPRIPG'17 [paper](https://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~anurag.ghosh/static/smarttennistv-automatic-indexing.pdf)
- Towards Structured Analysis of Broadcast Badminton Videos, WACV'18 [paper](http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/images/ConferencePapers/2018/badminton_analytics.pdf)

## Work to be done:
- Discuss about what problem I will be working on and start researching about it.
- Finish the annotation for Telugu data and start training the TTS model again.
